# Elasticsearch Service
For the initial `1.0.0` release, a simple search index is indexed and searched
through the AWS hosted [Elasticsearch Service][ES]. Elasticsearch is a full-text
search engine, based on [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/), that has been
optimized for running on Amazon's cloud.
