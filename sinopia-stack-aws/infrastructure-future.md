## Infrastructure Future(s)
Although [Sinopia][SINOPIA]'s infrastructure is container-based, built using
[Docker][DOCK], much of the implementation choices were done in the most
expedient manner by trying to use Amazon Web Services in as many places in the
infrastructure as possible. We recognize the danger of being too tightly
coupled with a particular cloud provider and in a future work-cycle
(we're always open to code Pull Requests!) we may look at using a more
open, cloud-neutral tool chains and approaches.
