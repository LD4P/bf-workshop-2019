## Background
An early requirement for the open-source [Sinopia][SINOPIA] project was to build a cloud-based
collaborative editing environment. The team choose [Amazon Web Services][AWS], one
of the most popular commercial cloud provider, by utilizing a number of different
AWS services and products to host Sinopia and its dependent technologies.
Although the first version of Sinopia is closely tied to specific AWS cloud
services, we are looking at more generic infrastructure options for hosting
Sinopia on other commercial cloud services as well as in hybrid environments.
